# Advent of code 2022
This is my first participation in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

My goal is not to write the smallest code and solve the puzzle as fast as possible,
my goal is to practice object-oriented programming and test driven development. Readable code is paramount. When you
read the code, it should be clear what problem was being solved. For this year, I've chosen python, a language 
where I have experience in. Maybe, if I can keep this up, next year it's time to choose another language.
